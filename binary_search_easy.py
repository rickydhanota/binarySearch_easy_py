# Binary Search
# Write a function that takes in a sorted array of integers as well as a target integer. The function should use the bonary search algorithm to determine if the target integer is container in the arry and should return its index if it is, otherwise -1
#array = [0,1, 2, 21, 33, 45, 45, 61, 71. 72, 73]
#target = 33
#output = 3
